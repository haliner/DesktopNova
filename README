Tools Needed for Building the Project
=====================================

 * CMake
 * g++
 * the Boost C++ library

Please note that this project is conforming to the C++11 standard. So the need
for a recent C++ compiler arises. That's why g++ 4.7 or above is recommended.


Building and Installing
=======================

The project uses CMake for makefile generation. It's recommended to build the
project not in the source directory. Use another dir as build directory. If
you want to adjust settings, pass them to CMake (via `-D' flag) or use ccmake
for the ncurses terminal program.

Example build:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
$ make
$ su
# make install
