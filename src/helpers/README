DesktopNova Helper Tools
========================

This directory contains all the sources for the helper tools which are shipped
with DesktopNova. The helpers have exactly one job: They are replacing the
current desktop background image for their desktop environment or subsystem.
The user is able to choose which helpers DesktopNova should run, so he has
a great deal of control over the process.

DesktopNova executes the resulting binaries in the following way:
  /path/to/binary/helper-foo <filename of new background image>

All helpers need to expect exact one positional argument: The filename of the
background image. Non-standard interfaces are NOT recommended.
